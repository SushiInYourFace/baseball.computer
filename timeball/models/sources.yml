          A truncated version of Retrosheet's gamelog file. It includes only
          games prior to 1901 (for which box sores are generally not available).
          This is our only source of info for those games, so it does not conflict
          with any of the later data in the play-by-play.

      These datasets are directly pulled from Retrosheet's box score files.
      Only games without original play-by-play accounts will have box score data;
      games with derived play-by-play accounts will have both box score and
      play-by-play data. In those dual-account games, box score data can still
      be useful for compiling fielding stats that cannot be directly attributed
      to a play.

      Unlike the play-by-play data, which is heavily parsed
      during data extraction, box score data is largely passed through
      without any enrichment or modification. Game-level metadata has the same shape
      as the game-level data from play-by-play games. Other tables come directly
      from a specific type of row in the box score file. These types
      can be divided into two groups:
      "lines", which roll up statistics to a player or team, and "events",
      which give more detailed information on notable plays.
